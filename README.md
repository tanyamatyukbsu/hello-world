This is my hello-world repo for version control

My name is Tanya. I am a person who enjoys learning so I am really looking forward to learn more about programming. I never would have thought I would be doing a Computer Science degree but I always was interested in pushing myself and I knew this would be a challenge for me so I figured all I can do is try it out and this is really growing on me.
